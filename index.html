			<h1>Part Three: Great Big Loveums</h1>
			<p>
				Bored with the endless silence of Francis, Kippums pressed onwards.
				Beyond the clearing was a path, leading to a valley and a lake.

				Sweet lovely Kippums walked along the lakeside, enjoying the look of the
				waterlilies and sassy frogs. She called out to nature: "Cooo coo!"
				Nature did not answer. However, she heard a rustling from deep within a
				grassy nub.

			<p>
				"Hello! It's me, Mr. Rock!" exclaimed Mr. Rock. "I have something
				extremely important to exclaim!"

				Kippums was astounded. That was nothing but gibberish! I wonder what on
				earth Mr. Rock could be on about?
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Rock continued to exclaim: "They call me Julius, or JC for short.
				You aren't going to stab me in the back, are you?"
